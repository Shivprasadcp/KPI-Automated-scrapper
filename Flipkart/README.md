This project scrapes the data of iphone products beacuse it has 3 pages for pagination , You can even change the url to some other mobile product.

No kind of installs required. 

After running the script scraped_data.csv file will be generated.



Kindly see to the code , because I am really looking to work with Pilgrim.

Hoping to meet in next round and eventually working with the team.
